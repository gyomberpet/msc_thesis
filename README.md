# End-to-end Autonomous Driving in Simulated Environments

This repository presents the work from my thesis, focusing on the development and evaluation of end-to-end autonomous driving algorithms within advanced simulation environments. A core aspect of this research involves the **NAVSIM simulation framework**, an innovative open-loop benchmarking tool. NAVSIM is particularly emphasized for its ability to address emerging challenges in autonomous driving evaluation, such as dataset imbalances and ensuring the credibility of evaluation metrics. It employs metrics that closely approximate those used in closed-loop simulators, assuming the autonomous vehicle's minimal short-term impact on its environment.

The thesis provides an in-depth presentation of this simulation framework, detailing aspects like data preparation, the implementation of various agents, and the methodologies used for evaluation. Beyond reviewing existing baseline models within NAVSIM, this study introduces several custom-designed agents. These agents represent diverse modeling strategies, including sophisticated transformer-based fusion models and experimental approaches that leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

Through a comprehensive comparative evaluation of these agents, the thesis offers valuable insights into the primary challenges inherent in designing effective autonomous driving algorithms. It also explores potential directions for resolving these issues and discusses novel perspectives that can serve as foundations for future research. Recognizing that evaluation in simulation is a critical precursor to real-world deployment of autonomous systems, the adoption of such advanced and reliable frameworks is essential for developing safe and effective driving algorithms.
